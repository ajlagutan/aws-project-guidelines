# Naming Conventions
These following guidelines are for naming the solution and project files, when using __Visual Studio__ or __Visual Studio Code__ as a choice of IDE.

__What is Pascal Case?__ [^1] [^3]

When using pascal case, every word starts with an uppercase letter (in contrast to camel case, where the first word is in lowercase).

Here are some examples of how you would use pascal case:
```python
NumberOfDonuts = 34

FavePhrase = "Hello, world"
```

You will see the pascal case used for naming classes in most programming languages.
